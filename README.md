# github-starred-repos-loader

Shell script for pull all your starred GitHub repositories in specifield folder.

## Purposes:

This script helps for pull all your GitHub starred repositories locally.

This is typically needed in a situation when you have many stared repositories to clone locally in a folder from remote repositories, such as collection of various utilities, and you want to create a "clear" repositories store from latest versions.



This script does simple things:

>> Gets list of your starred GitHub repositories.
>>
>> git clone in a specified folder
>> 
>> View clone statistics

## That's all!

*It works on GitHub only! (not in GitLab or BitBucket)

## Important!

If you have a lot of starred GitHub repositories, and they are big, clone operations may take a long time to complete.

## Usage:

- Clone this repository
- Run 'bash pull.sh ', aka this, and wait:

> bash pull.sh "/Volumes/Transcend/repos" "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN"
